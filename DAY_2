## 1.Introduction
This project focuses on the design and analysis of CMOS analog test circuits using Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment (ADE-L). The primary objective is to study the DC operating point, transient response, AC behavior, and small-signal gain of PMOS–NMOS based circuits. These analyses are essential for validating proper biasing, stability, and amplification characteristics of analog blocks such as current mirrors, amplifiers, and bias reference circuits (used in BGR and analog front-ends).
## Circuit Overview

This circuit consists of:
PMOS (PM1) connected to VDD acting as an active load
NMOS (NM2) connected to GND acting as the input-driven device
External DC bias (V4) applied to the PMOS gate
AC + DC input (V3) applied to the NMOS gate
Output taken at Vout3, the common drain node
This configuration represents a basic CMOS common-source amplifier with externally biased PMOS load, commonly used in analog signal amplification and bias testing.
